*DEPLOYING A MOVIE LISTING WEBSITE IN AWS CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH PROPER SCALING*

The Movie Listing website is a  web application built using ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB. 
It is a platform where users can upload movie details and images, and other users can view  the movies data uploaded into the website. 

The Movie Listing website uses React IS as the frontend technology.

The frontend of the Movie Listing website is built using ReactJS and is responsible for displaying the user interface to the end-users.
The backend of the Movie Listing website is deployed on an EC2 instance in the proposed deployment architecture, 
EC2 is a virtual machine in the cloud offered by AWS. 
It allows developers to run applications on a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. 
Docker is used for deployment, which is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications into containers

In this project we are deploying  website in the cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS)  and providing the load balancing .
This document outlines the technical steps included in the project, including the technology stack, installation guide, and deployment instructions.
